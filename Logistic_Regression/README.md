In this I applied Logistic Regression over PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset using sklearn modules.  The Features Engineering steps involved normalisation, analysing Pearsonâ€™s Correlation matrix, and doing Multivariate analysis using Pair Plot. Trained Logistic Regression model and various scores like accuracy, roc_auc _score, precision, recall and F1 score at various stages. Finally did Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid-Search CV and increased accuracy by 5%. Worked on this project for Kaggle Competition.
